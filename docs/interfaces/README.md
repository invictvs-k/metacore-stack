# Interfaces

This directory contains machine-readable interface contracts and API specifications.

## Purpose

Store formal API contracts, OpenAPI specifications, GraphQL schemas, and other interface definitions that define the boundaries between system components.

## Usage

- Place OpenAPI/Swagger specifications here
- Store GraphQL schemas
- Document service contracts
- Include TypeScript interface definitions or similar type contracts
- Add protocol buffer definitions if applicable

## Convention

Files should be named descriptively:
- `{component-name}.openapi.yaml` for OpenAPI specs
- `{component-name}.graphql` for GraphQL schemas
- `{component-name}.proto` for protocol buffers
- `{component-name}-contract.ts` for TypeScript contracts

## Status

This directory is currently a placeholder. Interface specifications will be added as the system architecture solidifies.
