# Runbooks

This directory contains operational runbooks for common tasks and troubleshooting procedures.

## Purpose

Runbooks are step-by-step guides for:
- Deployment procedures
- Incident response
- Common maintenance tasks
- Troubleshooting guides
- Recovery procedures

## Creating a Runbook

A good runbook should include:

1. **Purpose**: What this runbook helps you accomplish
2. **Prerequisites**: What you need before starting
3. **Steps**: Clear, numbered steps to follow
4. **Expected Results**: What success looks like
5. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
6. **Rollback**: How to undo changes if needed

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the task:
- `deploy-{component}.md`
- `troubleshoot-{issue}.md`
- `recover-{scenario}.md`
- `upgrade-{component}.md`

## Status

This directory is ready for runbook documentation. Add runbooks as operational procedures are established.
