## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive organization and scaffolding of documentation files in the repository.  
The work was performed following the principle of **Foundation & Discovery** - creating infrastructure without breaking existing functionality.

### Statistics

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Total Documents** | 58 | 100% |
| Active | 42 | 72% |
| Deprecated | 10 | 17% |
| Archived | 6 | 10% |
| Files with Broken Links | 2 | 3% |

## Tag Taxonomy

The documentation uses a two-tier tag system for categorization:

**Core Tags** (original specification):
- `architecture` - Architectural designs and high-level system views
- `api` - API documentation and contracts
- `howto` - How-to guides and tutorials
- `adr` - Architecture Decision Records
- `ops` - Operations and deployment guides
- `design` - Design documents and diagrams

**Extended Tags** (evolved during curation):
- `testing` - Testing guides and test documentation
- `implementation` - Implementation summaries and details
- `runbook` - Operational runbooks
- `agent` - Agent scaffolding and guides
- `spec` - Specifications and formal contracts
- `archive` - Archived documentation
- `deprecated` - Deprecated documentation

This taxonomy is documented in `docs/docs.manifest.json` under the `tagTaxonomy` field.

## Technical Details

### Link Resolution Strategy

The TOC uses **relative links** to avoid false-positive broken link detection:
- Files within `docs/` use `./` prefix (e.g., `./glossary.md`)
- Files outside `docs/` use `../` prefix (e.g., `../README.md`)
- Root-anchored links (starting with `/`) are avoided to ensure proper resolution by static site generators and file browsers

### Manifest Generation

The manifest is generated automatically using Node.js scripts that:
- Scan all `.md` and `.mdx` files (excluding `node_modules`, `dist`, `.artifacts`)
- Extract H1 titles and metadata
- Analyze content for tag classification
- Track incoming and outgoing links
- Validate link integrity
- Determine document status based on location and content

## Impact Assessment

### Build Impact: âœ… NONE

- No code files were modified
- No project references were changed
- All changes are documentation and scaffolding only
- Build configurations remain untouched

### Breaking Changes: âœ… NONE

- All existing documentation remains accessible
- New directories are additive only
- No files were deleted or moved
- No hard dependencies created

---

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required: NONE âœ…

The infrastructure is complete and ready for use. No immediate action required.

### Suggested Follow-Up Work

1. **Broken Links** - Review and fix files with broken links:
   - DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md
   - docs/_archive/BACKEND_API_TEST_PLAN.md

2. **Agent Briefs** - Start using the brief templates for focused tasks:
   - Create briefs in `docs/agent/briefs/` for upcoming work
   - Follow the guide in `docs/agent/briefs/README.md`

3. **Playbooks** - Document complex workflows:
   - Create playbooks for release, migration, or refactoring efforts
   - Use the template in `docs/agent/templates/playbook-template.md`

4. **Context Cards** - Expand context documentation:
   - Create CONTEXT.md for other components (server-dotnet, mcp-ts, etc.)
   - Keep cards updated as components evolve

5. **Runbooks** - Document operational procedures:
   - Create runbooks for deployment, troubleshooting, recovery
   - Place in `docs/runbooks/`

6. **Interface Specifications** - Formalize API contracts:
   - Add OpenAPI/Swagger specs to `docs/interfaces/`
   - Document service contracts and protocols

7. **Configuration Schemas** - Define config validation:
   - Create JSON schemas for configuration files
   - Add to `configs/schemas/`

### Long-term Maintenance

1. **Regular Reviews** - Schedule quarterly documentation reviews
2. **Manifest Updates** - Regenerate manifest when docs change significantly
3. **Link Checking** - Set up automated link checking in CI (with proper support for relative links)
4. **Glossary Updates** - Keep glossary current as new terms emerge
5. **Tag Taxonomy** - Review and refine tags as documentation evolves

|------|-------------|---------|
| `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` | 3 | Updated links to archived files (TEST_SETUP.md, VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md), fixed link to QUICKSTART.md |
| `docs/_archive/BACKEND_API_TEST_PLAN.md` | 1 | Removed broken reference to deleted Startup.cs file |

### Archive Banners Added

All archived files now have standardized archive banners:

| File | Status | Banner Added |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `docs/_archive/BACKEND_API_TEST_PLAN.md` | archived | âœ… |
| `docs/_archive/ENVIRONMENT_VERIFICATION.md` | archived | âœ… |
| `docs/_archive/TEST_SETUP.md` | archived | âœ… |
| `docs/_archive/ROOM_HOST_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | archived | âœ… |
| `docs/_archive/ROOMOPERATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | archived | âœ… |
| `docs/_archive/VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` | archived | âœ… |

### Front-Matter Added

Standardized YAML front-matter added to key active documentation files:

| File | Status | Tags |
|------|--------|------|
| `docs/TESTING.md` | active | testing, howto, integration |
| `docs/glossary.md` | active | architecture, api, spec |
| `docs/room-operator.md` | active | architecture, ops, spec |
| `docs/INTEGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | active | implementation, architecture, integration |
| `docs/MCP_CONNECTION_BEHAVIOR.md` | active | architecture, implementation, mcp |
| `docs/ROOMOPERATOR_ROOMSERVER_INTEGRATION.md` | active | architecture, integration, howto |

### Schema Placeholders Created

Machine-readable contract schemas created in `configs/schemas/`:

| Schema | Type | Purpose | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| `integration-api.openapi.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.0 | Integration API specification | Placeholder - to be filled in Prompt 3 |
| `sse.events.schema.json` | JSON Schema | SSE event payload structure | Placeholder - to be filled in Prompt 3 |
| `commands.catalog.schema.json` | JSON Schema | Command catalog definition | Placeholder - to be filled in Prompt 3 |

### Documentation Updates

| File | Update |
|------|--------|
| `configs/schemas/README.md` | Added references to new schema files |
| `docs/interfaces/README.md` | Added links to schema placeholders |

### Duplicates Verified

| File | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `CONFIGURACAO_PORTAS.md` | duplicate | Already has redirection banner to PORT_CONFIGURATION.md - no action needed |

### Manual Follow-Ups

None identified at this stage. All actions completed successfully.

### Next Steps (for Prompt 3)

1. **Populate Schemas**: Fill in the placeholder schemas with actual:
   - API endpoints and models (integration-api.openapi.yaml)
   - Event types and payloads (sse.events.schema.json)
   - Command definitions and parameters (commands.catalog.schema.json)

2. **Build/CI Alignment**: Update build and CI configurations to:
   - Validate schemas during build
   - Run contract tests against schemas
   - Use path filters to trigger appropriate builds

3. **Contract Tests**: Create tests that validate:
   - API responses match OpenAPI spec
   - SSE events match JSON schema
   - Commands match catalog schema
