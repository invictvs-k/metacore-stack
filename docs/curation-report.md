## Actions Performed

### 1. Directory Structure Created

The following directories were created to organize documentation:

- `.artifacts/` - For test artifacts and build outputs
- `docs/_archive/` - For archived/obsolete documentation
- `docs/_deprecated/` - For deprecated documentation (historical reference)
- `docs/_adr/` - For Architecture Decision Records
- `.repo_fixup_backup/` - Automatic backups of moved/modified files

### 2. Standard Files Created

The following standard repository files were created:

- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy and vulnerability reporting guidelines
- `CODEOWNERS` - Code ownership definitions for GitHub
- `docs/_adr/000-template.md` - Template for Architecture Decision Records

### 3. Files Moved and Categorized

All file moves were performed using `git mv` to preserve history.  
Backups were created in `.repo_fixup_backup/` before any modifications.

#### Deprecated Files (Implementation Summaries & Fix Explanations)

## Impact Assessment

### Build Impact: ✅ NONE

- No code files were modified
- No project references were changed
- All moves used `git mv` to preserve history
- Build configurations remain untouched

### Breaking Changes: ✅ NONE

- All documentation remains accessible
- Deprecated/archived files have banners with links to current docs
- No hard deletions performed

## Artifacts Generated

1. **`docs/docs.manifest.json`** - Complete inventory of documentation with metadata
2. **`docs/TOC.md`** - Organized table of contents
3. **`docs/curation-report.md`** - This report
4. **`docs/_adr/000-template.md`** - ADR template for future architecture decisions
5. **Backups** - All modified files backed up to `.repo_fixup_backup/`

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Broken bookmarks to moved files | Low | Files kept in git history, redirects via banners |
| Links in external docs | Low | Old paths still accessible via git history |
| User confusion about file locations | Low | Clear banners, comprehensive TOC |

### Risk Level: **LOW** ✅

All risks are mitigated through:
- Non-destructive moves (git mv preserves history)
- Clear banners with navigation links
- Comprehensive documentation (TOC, manifest, report)
- Complete backups in `.repo_fixup_backup/`

---

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required: NONE ✅

The curation is complete and safe. No immediate action required.

### Suggested Manual Reviews

1. **Broken Links** - Review files with broken links and update or remove:
   - DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md
   - README.md
   - docs/_archive/BACKEND_API_TEST_PLAN.md

2. **Owners** - Consider adding owners to documentation files in CODEOWNERS

3. **ADRs** - Formalize architecture decisions as ADRs using the template:
   - Consider creating ADRs for major past decisions found in deprecated docs

4. **Consolidation** - Consider merging duplicate content:
   - CONFIGURACAO_PORTAS.md (Portuguese) could be removed if English is primary

### Long-term Maintenance

1. **Regular Reviews** - Schedule quarterly documentation reviews
2. **ADR Practice** - Adopt ADR practice for future architecture decisions
3. **Link Checking** - Set up automated link checking in CI
4. **Ownership** - Assign owners to documentation sections
